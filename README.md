Beyond Vanilla - QoL
====================


About
-----

*Beyond Vanilla - QoL* is a modpack designed with vanilla gameplay in mind with non-game-changing quality-of-life improvements.

It is primarily designed for players that have already completed a pure vanilla (unmodded) game, and that want to keep playing with vanilla recipes and mechanics while making some minor improvements to their gameplay experience.

It should be particularly well suited for players who are looking into designing and building entry-level megabases.

Design decisions for the modpack are:

- Make common actions easier throughout the game.
- Make it easier to manage and plan the factory.
- Improve feedback from the game.
- Do not change the core mechanics.
- Do not change vanilla recipes.
- Do not introduce additional recipes.
- Do not introduce additional entities.
- Created blueprints and bases must be fully functional both with and without the modpack's selection of mods.
- Mods should come pre-configured with sane defaults to make all of this possible.
- Prefer mods with Free (as in Freedom) License that allows for code to be shared and improved.


Features
--------


### Game feedback

- Alerts for turrets low on ammo ([Ammo Alerts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Gun_Turret_Alerts))
> Show map alerts for turrets low on ammo (5 magazines by default). Useful for early game defenses and detecting issues with ammo delivery systems.

- Automated painting of trains/stations based on transported/delivered ingredients ([Automatic Station Painter](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/automatic-station-painter), [Automatic Train Painter](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/automatic-station-painter), [Fluid Wagon Color Mask](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FluidWagonColorMask))
> Automatically paints locomotives, wagons, and train stations to match the transported items. Helps differentiate between them visually. Use *Manual Color Module* in trains to preserve their current paint.

As the old metaphor goes, this modpack stands on the shoulders of the giants. It would never be possible to create if it were not for both Wube Software's dedication to the game and its modding capabilities, nor without the many modders that have selflessly contributed their time and effort to creation of all the wonderous mods that are included in this modpack.

I salute you, and thank you for making all of this possible and available in such a user-friendly form!
