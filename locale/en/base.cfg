[mod-setting-description]
beyond-vanilla-qol-enable-modpack-controls-configuration=Enables modpack controls configuration for mods. Reconfigures controls from the mods in such a way to avoid overlaps and collisions within same context. Player-customised controls are left intact (enforced by game engine itself, not the modpack).
